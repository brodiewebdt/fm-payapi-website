## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   Javascript

### What I learned

This was the most involved project I have done to date. Creating multiple pages with different layouts and different types of Javascript was a challenge. I found that the layout and styling was easier than I thought. That is from the multiple projects I have worked on in Frontend Mentor. I had to use different Javascript files for the different pages as I couldn't get it to work from one file only.

### Continued development

I am working on projects with multiple pages and learning how to create custom elements. I also need to work on my Javascript skills some more.

### Useful resources
